## Introduction
* The Construct: Decentralized Robotics Exchange (DREX) seeks to revolutionize the field of robotics by introducing a decentralized platform for the free and open exchange of robotic designs, robot bodies, components, and software. The DREX platform is designed to function as both a marketplace and a collaborative environment, leveraging blockchain technology to maintain a secure and transparent system. The project's ultimate goal is to create a unified ecosystem where hobbyists, engineers, and manufacturers can innovate and collaborate in the field of robotics.

## Scope
* The scope of the DREX encompasses creating a secure, scalable, and user-friendly decentralized exchange that facilitates the sharing, trading, and manufacturing of robots, robotic components and designs. We aim to deliver a robust platform with features such as smart contract-based transactions, a token economy, and decentralized manufacturing capabilities.

## Functional Requirements
* User Registration and Authentication

- Registration of new users through a secure protocol.
- Authentication of users with multi-factor authentication for access control.

* Component Listing and Exchange
- Users can list robotic components with detailed descriptions.
- Exchange of components through a secure transaction system supported by smart contracts.

* Robotics Design Collaboration
- A feature to collaborate on robot designs, including version control and contributor tracking.

* Decentralized Manufacturing Platform
- Integration with a network of decentralized manufacturers.
- Smart contract-based ordering and manufacturing process control.

* Voting and Governance
- A governance model that allows token holders to vote on significant platform decisions.

* Digital Wallet Integration
- Integration with digital wallets to hold and transact in the platform's native tokens and other cryptocurrencies.

* Marketplace Analytics
- Real-time analytics of marketplace activities, such as trending components and transaction volumes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
* Performance: The platform should handle high transaction throughput with minimal latency.
* Scalability: Capable of scaling out to accommodate growing numbers of users and transactions.
* Security: Adherence to top-tier security standards to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities, ensuring the protection of user data and the integrity of transactions.
* Usability: Accessibility and user-friendly interface design for a broad demographic of users.
* Compliance: Compliance with global regulatory standards for blockchain-based platforms and financial transactions.

## System Architecture
The system architecture uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to support the backend services, decentralized applications (DApps), and database management. A modular approach divides the system into several interconnected layers:

* Presentation Layer: User interface components and DApp browsers.
* Business Logic Layer: Smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance models.
* Data Layer: Blockchain nodes, data storage, and retrieval services.

Protocols:
- Injective/Cosmwasm: Smart contracts and interoperable DeFi protocols enabling seamless cross-chain asset trading
- Solana: Asset Tokenization (NFT's)

Proposed services (Demo): 
- Cloud Run
- Cloud Storage
- Firestore
- Cloud Functions
- PubSub
- BigQuery
- Kubernetes Engine
- Cloud Monitoring and Logging

## Data Model
The data model consists of several key components such as:

* Storing user data and profiles.
* Metadata, ownership, and transaction history of robots and robotic components.
* Design files, collaboration records, and versioning information.


## User Interface (UI)
The UI will combine aesthetic appeal with functionality, offering:

* Intuitive navigation through the platform.
* Clear, concise information display with a minimalist design.
* Responsive design to accommodate various devices and screen sizes.

## Security Requirements
The platform will employ several layers of security:

* Data encryption in transit and at rest.
* Regular security audits and penetration testing.
* Implementation of industry-standard security protocols for smart contracts.


## Testing and Quality Assurance
Testing strategies include:

* Automated unit and integration testing to ensure code integrity.
* Simulation of user interactions with the platform for usability testing.
* Bug bounties and third-party audits for additional layers of scrutiny.

Success in testing and QA will be benchmarked against predefined criteria, such as transaction processing times, system uptime, and user satisfaction scores.

## Deployment and Delivery
Deployment will involve:

* Staging environments for testing before production release.
* Serverless deployment models on GCP for high availability and elasticity.
* Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for smooth rollouts.

## Maintenance and Support
After launch, the platform will receive:

* Regular updates to introduce new features and address potential issues.
* A dedicated support team to assist users with any platform-related queries.
