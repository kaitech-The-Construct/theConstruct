# API Gateway

## Overview
* The API Gateway serves as the central entry point to our system, responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices, aggregating requests, and performing protocol translation when necessary. It also plays a critical role in ensuring security, handling authentication, and implementing rate-limiting to protect our system.

## Key Features

### Request Routing: 
* Directs incoming requests to the relevant microservice, ensuring efficient and optimized processing.

### Request Aggregation: 
* Consolidates multiple requests into a single request to reduce latency and improve performance.

### Security: 
* Implements robust security measures, including authentication and rate-limiting, to protect against malicious actors and ensure system integrity.
