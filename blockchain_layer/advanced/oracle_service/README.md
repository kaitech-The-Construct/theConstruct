# Oracles

## Overview
* The Oracles Microservice acts as a bridge between our decentralized applications and external data sources. It fetches real-time data such as price feeds, exchange rates, and other essential information from external sources and feeds it into our smart contracts as needed. This ensures that our DeFi project has access to accurate and up-to-date information.

## Key Features

### External Data Integration: 
* Fetches data from trusted external sources to provide reliable and real-time information to our smart contracts.

### Data Feeding: 
* Feeds external data into smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications to make data-driven decisions.
