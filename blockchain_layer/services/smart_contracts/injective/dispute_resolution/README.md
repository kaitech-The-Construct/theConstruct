The code provided defines a framework with placeholders for implementation details. You'll need to fill out the logic for each placeholder section (// Implement logic...), adhere to best practices handling various dispute resolution outcomes, and secure operations with proper authorization checks. Moreover, integration tests should be expanded to cover various dispute outcomes and include testing for proper error handling.

Finally, this overview is quite simplistic in detail, and a real-world contract could include complex logic like mediator or arbitrator roles, multi-step resolutions, appeals, third-party intervention, time constraints, etc. The actual implementation will need to thoroughly cover these aspects as appropriate for the intended use case.
